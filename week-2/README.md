# Challenge: Make Those Requests Fast

In this challenge, you're required to create a script/program which will take url with protocol as argument. For example: https://google.com and hit 10,000 requests into the website. 

The main point of this challenge is to make sure you know how concurrency / parallelism works and you can implement them to stop **Blocking for Networking I/O** from being a bottleneck in your program.

Please read the example and guidelines.

## Example

```bash
$ python main.py https://facebook.com
Done in [x - seconds]
```


## Guidelines

- Try not to include any dependencies and solve by using the data structures and standard functions given by the language itself.

- Don't try to edit other's solution or copy other's solution as it's just for you to improve and try interesting challenges yourself and submit your solution by making respective folder or your username.

- You're allowed to use any language and any tools but try to implement it from as scratch as possible.

- Your benchmark will be done on a single machine and this document will be updated with the name of the person with fastest implementation of this challenge solution.

- If you're using rust or go, do not use external crate or packages and also if it's most needed then make sure, you include a go.mod file or similar toml file.
